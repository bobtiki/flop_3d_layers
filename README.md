# Flop 3D Layers

***WORK IN PROGRESS***

Slic3r PE has some really nice supports and slicing for printing with the Prusa SL1 UV resin printer, but for printing on a Wanhao D7, these images are backwards, and result in "inside out" 3D prints. This script will flop all of the images and re-zip for easy upload to [NanoDLP](https://www.nanodlp.com/) and printing.
